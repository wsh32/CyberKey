						<h5>Key Club Pledge</h5>
						<p>I pledge on my honor to uphold the objects of Key Club International; to build my home, school, and community; to serve my nation and God; and combat all forces which tend to undermine these institutions.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="kc" class="col s12">
						<br>
						<h5>Key Club International</h5>
						<p>The first Key Club formed in 1925 in Sacramento, California with 11 charter members. Key Club was the idea of two Sacramento Kiwanis club members, Albert C. Olney and Frank C. Vincent, who also were high school administrators. They approached their Kiwanis club with the idea of starting a junior service club in the high school. It would resemble Kiwanis, have its own classifications based on school interests and hold luncheon meetings. The club was comprised of the key boys in the school, willing to serve the school in any way possible and to create better school spirit. Thus, the club was dubbed Key Club. Soon, the club that started out as a vocational guidance program expanded to become a complete service organization for the whole school. It also offered a social aspect to balance its service activities. Today, Key Club is the oldest and largest service program for high school students in the world. It has more than 250,000 members in 5,000 clubs in 30 countries. Check out a timeline of important dates in the organizationâ€™s long history or read the Key Club story.</p>

					<div id="cnh" class="col s12">
						<br>
						<h5>Cal-Nev-Ha</h5>
						<p>The California-Nevada-Hawaii district, Cali-Nev-Ha, or CNH is the largest district in Key Club with over 45,000 members and over 60 divisions. CNH is also the oldest district of Key Club, having been founded in 1925 when a student led service organization was chartered in Sacramento High School. Key Club was founded when eleven students were looking for a high school level service club. As such, these students signed a petition and sent it to Kiwanis International, and by the time the club was approved, it had grown to have 25 students. Each year, CNH holds two rallys, Fall Rally North and Fall Rally South, to celebrate a year of service and giving. Funds and ticket sales from both of these events go towards the Pediatric Trauma Program.</p>

						<h5>CAMS Key Club</h5>
						<p>CAMS Key Club is a service club that promotes student leadership and cooperation. We are a subsidiary of Division 19 North, Region 8, District Cali-Nev-Ha. We serve, therefore we bee. We are a club stationed on the California Academy of Mathematics and Science, located on the campus of Cal Stat Dominguez Hills. Key Club is the oldest, and one of the biggest clubs at the school and our members pride themselves in bettering the community and themselves. The core values of CAMS Key Club are Character-Building, Caring, Inclusiveness, and Leadership. Key Club helps build character by offering opportunities for members to help others through service, work, and discipline. Through service, the members show that they care about their home, school, community, and peers. Key Club is open to anyone who is interested in being a leader in his or her school community and wishes to provide service to others. Anyone who wants to be included is part of the Key Club family. Since Key Club is student-led, it offers many opportunities for interested members to practice leadership skills in various offices and chair positions.
						<br><br>
						CAMS Key Club is a part of a larger group which encompasses over ten different key clubs within the Los Angeles area, Division 19 North. The mascot for D19N is the Pirate Penguin, and together with members from other schools, CAMS Key Clubbers are able to participate in additional exciting events and make new friends. Our Division is part of an even larger group with divisions from all over California, Nevada and Hawaii- the Cali-Nev-Ha District. And once again, the district with other districts around the world form the whole of Key Club International. Whether our students are serving in our club, division, or even district, CAMS Key Clubbers feel a sense of pride in being a part of something much larger than themselves.</p>
